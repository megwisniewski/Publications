During my time as a Statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau, I primarily worked with data from the American Community Survey (ACS). My research focused on labor market trends and gender wage inequality. I contributed to several public-facing data products and analyses, including the following stories:

- [What Is the Gender Wage Gap in Your State?](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/03/what-is-the-gender-wage-gap-in-your-state.html)
- [Unequally Essential: Women and the Gender Pay Gap During COVID-19](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/03/unequally-essential-women-and-gender-pay-gap-during-covid-19.html)
- [Housing Costs Burden Americans Differently Across the U.S.](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/12/housing-costs-burden.html)
