Welcome! I am Megan Wisniewski, a PhD student in Demography and Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. I am also pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Statistics and Data Science at the Wharton School.

My research broadly focuses on labor economics in the United States, ranging from occupational coding to wage inequality. Before beginning my PhD, I worked as a Statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau in the Industry & Occupation Statistics Branch.
