Hello! I am Megan Wisniewski, a PhD student in Demography and Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. I am also pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Statistics and Data Science at the Wharton School.

My research broadly focuses on labor economics in the United States, ranging from occupational coding to wage inequality. Before beginning my PhD, I worked as a Statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau in the Industry & Occupation Statistics Branch. 

During my time as a Statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau, I primarily worked with data from the American Community Survey (ACS). My research focused on labor market trends and wage inequality. I contributed to several public-facing data products and analyses, including the following stories:

- [What Is the Gender Wage Gap in Your State?](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/03/what-is-the-gender-wage-gap-in-your-state.html)
- [Unequally Essential: Women and the Gender Pay Gap During COVID-19](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/03/unequally-essential-women-and-gender-pay-gap-during-covid-19.html)
- [Housing Costs Burden Americans Differently Across the U.S.](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/12/housing-costs-burden.html)

I am also a co-author on a peer-reviewed Social Science & Medicine article entitled: ["Clinic access and teenage birth rates: Racial/ethnic and spatial disparities in Houston, TX"] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953618300650) published in 2018.
