Welcome! This repository is a portfolio of my work. My research broadly focuses on labor economics in the United States. Before beginning my PhD program in Demography and Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, I worked as a Statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau in the Industry & Occupation Statistics Branch. I am also pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Statistics and Data Science at the Wharton School. Please contact me if you have any questions: meganwis ~at~ upenn ~dot~ edu.
